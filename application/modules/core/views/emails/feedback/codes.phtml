Dear Sir/Madam,
<p>
This email provides you with the anonymised link which you should follow to provide feedback for <?= $this->conferenceInfo('name') ?>. Please click the following link to provide your feedback:
<br><br>
<? $link = $this->url(array('controller' => 'feedback', 'action' => 'index', 'uuid' => $this->values['uuid']), 'feedback'); ?>
<a href="<?=$link ?>"><?= $link ?></a>
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to have <i>javascript enabled</i> in your browser to
submit feedback about presentations.
</p>

<h3>How this on-line evaluation works</h3>
<p>
After clicking the link, the TERENA website will try to set a cookie on
your computer that will expire after 14 days. This cookie simply makes
it easier for you to revisit the feedback form before you finally submit
it, and it is not used to track your identity in any way.
</p><p>
This means that you can return to the form as often as you like (with
the same web enabled device) and give your feedback and/or change your
mind. If you wish to complete the feedback using a second device, then
you should click the above link from that device as well.
</p><p>
If you have any problems, please contact us at the email address below,
do not reply to this email as it is automatically generated.
</p><p>
Kind regards and thank you for your valuable feedback!
