CORE is the software used to build the TERENA Networking Conference website and its conference schedule. It makes it possible for a conference organiser or web developer to manage multiple conferences at the same time. It is simple, open, and federated.

Documentation lives on the [TERENA wiki](https://confluence.terena.org/display/core/About)
